-- Revenue by traffic source by week, by month in June 2017
-- Hint 1: separate month and week data then union all.
-- Hint 2: at time_type, you can [SELECT 'Month' as time_type] to print time_type column
-- Hint 3: use "productRevenue" to calculate revenue. You need to unnest hits and product to access productRevenue field (example at the end of page).
-- Hint 4: To shorten the result, productRevenue should be divided by 1000000
-- Hint 5: Add condition "product.productRevenue is not null" to calculate correctly

-- OUTPUT 4 cá»™t: time_type, time, source, revenue
